<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module will allow admins to set up a whitelist or blacklist for allowed email registration domains.</p>

<h3>Settings and Examples</h3>

<p>This module has two different methods: whitelist and blacklist modes. The blacklist mode will reject any registrations from email addresses, domains, or partial word matches that you set up. The whitelist does the opposite and will only accept registrations from a list of allowed phrases. The module only checks the ending part of an email address, so if you enter the word "test" as a blacklist word it would block foo@bar.sampletest, but not foo@test.bar.</p>

<p><strong>Blacklist Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding @mailinator.com would block only email addresses ending with "@mailinator.com".</li>
	<li>Adding ".ru" would ban foo@bar.co.ru, but not foo@bar.ru.co</li>
	<li>Adding "bar" would only block domains ending with "bar" (ex. the address email@foo.bar)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whitelist Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding "@company.com" would only allow addresses ending with @company.com when using the whitelist method.</li>
	<li>Adding ".edu" would only allow .edu addresses (plus other exceptions added to the list)</li>
</ul>
